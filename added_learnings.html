        <h2>Self Study</h2>
        <p>
          Good interface design takes time and effort, but small, thoughtful
          decisions—such as considering real users and involving them early—can
          prevent serious design flaws. The Automatic syringe example shows how
          a numeric keypad interface led to a dangerous tenfold dosage error, a
          problem that was only discovered after consulting hospital staff.
        </p>
        <article>
          <h3>Analyzing the Syringe Interface Using Different Models</h3>
          <p>
            The following sections explain how Norman’s Model, GOMS, and KLM
            each analyze the redesign of the syringe interface, which replaced a
            numeric keypad with increment and decrement buttons.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>Norman’s Cycle of Action</h4>
          <p>
            Norman’s model highlights a large gulf of execution in the original
            keypad design. The user’s goal of setting an accurate dose was
            poorly supported, since a single extra key press could result in a
            fatal dosage. The redesigned button-based interface reduces this
            gulf by better matching the user’s intentions with safe, controlled
            actions.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>GOMS Model</h4>
          <p>
            Using GOMS, the task of entering a dose is broken down into goals,
            methods, and operators. The keypad method allows faster input but
            provides limited support for detecting or correcting errors. In
            contrast, the button-based method is slower but forces users to
            verify each adjustment, improving safety during the task.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h4>
          <p>
            KLM focuses on predicting execution time for expert users. It would
            likely show that entering a dose with a keypad is faster due to
            fewer keystrokes, while button presses take longer. However, this
            comparison also demonstrates that speed alone is not an appropriate
            measure for safety-critical systems like medical devices.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h4>The Importance of Iteration</h4>
          <p>
            Since people and contexts are complex, interface design rarely
            succeeds on the first attempt. Creating early prototypes and
            involving users throughout the design process helps identify serious
            flaws before they become permanently embedded in the system.

          <h3>Norman’s Model of Interaction</h3>
          <p>
            Donald Norman is a key figure in Human–Computer Interaction and is
            well known for promoting user-centered design, usability, and
            cognitive engineering. His model of interaction is influential
            because it closely matches how users naturally think about and
            interact with computer systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Norman’s model, interaction begins when a user forms a
            goal and plans how to achieve it. The user then performs actions
            through the interface. After executing these actions, the user
            observes the system’s response and evaluates whether the outcome
            matches their original goal, deciding what to do next.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>The Seven Stages of Action</h4>
          <p>
            Norman divides interaction into two main phases: execution and
            evaluation. Together, these phases consist of seven stages:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Establishing the goal</li>
            <li>Forming the intention</li>
            <li>Specifying the action sequence</li>
            <li>Executing the action</li>
            <li>Perceiving the system state</li>
            <li>Interpreting the system state</li>
            <li>Evaluating the outcome against the goal</li>
          </ol>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation</h4>
          <p>
            Norman uses this model to explain why users struggle with poorly
            designed interfaces. The gulf of execution refers to the gap between
            what a user wants to do and the actions the system makes available.
            The gulf of evaluation refers to the gap between what the system
            does and how easily the user can understand the result.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>Human Error: Slips and Mistakes</h4>
          <p>
            Human errors can be divided into slips and mistakes. Slips occur
            when the user understands the system but performs the action
            incorrectly, such as mistyping or clicking the wrong button.
            Mistakes occur when the user forms the wrong goal due to
            misunderstanding the system, such as misinterpreting an icon’s
            meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slips can often be reduced through better interface design, like
            increasing spacing between buttons. Mistakes usually require deeper
            changes, such as redesigning the interface, improving training, or
            using clearer metaphors.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>GOMS Model</h3>
          <p>
            The GOMS model, developed by Card, Moran, and Newell, describes how
            users complete tasks by breaking interaction into Goals, Operators,
            Methods, and Selection rules. It helps designers understand both the
            cognitive and physical steps involved in task performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Goals represent what the user wants to achieve. Operators are basic
            actions such as pressing a key or reading a dialog box. Methods
            describe different ways of achieving a goal, while selection rules
            determine which method a user chooses based on context or habit.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>Design Focus: Why GOMS Saves Money</h4>
          <p>
            GOMS has been used in real-world system evaluations. For example,
            the telephone company NYNEX used GOMS to analyze a proposed computer
            system and discovered it would be slower than the existing one. As a
            result, the company abandoned the project, saving millions of
            dollars.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h3>
          <p>
            The Keystroke-Level Model is a detailed extension of GOMS that
            focuses on predicting execution time for expert users performing
            routine tasks. It is designed for short, well-defined tasks that
            usually take less than 20 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            KLM assumes error-free performance and concentrates only on the
            execution phase of interaction. It breaks tasks into low-level
            operators such as key presses, mouse clicks, pointing, hand
            movement, mental preparation, and system response time.
          </p>
          <p>
            By assigning standard time values to each operator and summing them,
            KLM allows designers to compare different interface designs or task
            methods and predict which one will be faster—without running full
            user experiments.

          <h3>HCI Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) combines concepts from
            <strong>Cognitive Psychology</strong>, <strong>Design</strong>, and
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> to understand how humans interact
            with technology.

          <h3>Human Behavior and Memory</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Humans often perform tasks based on how they were taught or what
              they observed at a young age (e.g., drawing a glass from memory).
            </li>
            <li>
              Habits can be changed, but the fundamental nature of a person
              remains stable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Humans store information in:
              <ul>
                <li>Short-Term Memory (STM)</li>
                <li>Long-Term Memory (LTM)</li>

            <li>
              Cognitive Neural Networks (CNNs) resemble human processing by

              Chunking breaks large information into smaller units (e.g.,
              1234567890 → 123-456-7890).

          <h3>UI vs UX</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>UI (User Interface)</strong> focuses on the visual design of
            a product and how it looks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>UX (User Experience)</strong> focuses on the overall
            experience and how the product feels to use, including usability and
            satisfaction.

          <h3>The Automatic Syringe Case</h3>
          <p>
            The Automatic Syringe case demonstrates how small interface design
            decisions can lead to serious consequences. Numeric keypads caused
            dangerous input errors due to accidental key presses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interfaces rarely work perfectly on the first attempt, making
            iteration essential. Early prototypes should be easy to modify or
            discard, and rapid prototyping techniques such as paper sketches and
            mock-ups help designers test ideas quickly before full development.
